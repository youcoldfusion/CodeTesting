Code testing is very important before deploying any websites in development,
stage and production servers.Developers should also do Unit Testing and if it is fine,
noramlly applications should be tested by Testers before deploying it to Production.
We can do manual testing and automation testion.If the companies and projects are big,
separate developers are used.Other wise in small companies and projects,
websites are tested properly by the developers.
